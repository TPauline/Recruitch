# TA and Peer feedback
 The TA stated that the login/register forms didnt respond. therefore this time I implemened code that checked the informaton entered to determine if the user inputed the valid infomation.
 I also have alerts before trashtions to a different page. So like the TA suggested the users get massages indicating successful/unsuccessful inputs.
 I only had one peer review. They stated that my logo was not bright enough. In order to address this issue I darkned the background and sourrounding  colors around the logo to that it is more visibble.


 # API
 I amd planing on using Firebase as my API for the final project.

 # Questions
 I would like advice/help on how to handle storing and retriving user data such that. When someone loggs in all data shows in specfic to them.
 I am unsure how to implement a Vidoechat element in my project for my consultation page. also how to so the messages too.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
